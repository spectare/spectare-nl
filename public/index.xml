This is a small note to self in order to keep a record of aspects that need to be addressed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The kick off is the first step of a continuous mechanism to learn and deliver the best possible outcome for your audience.&lt;/p>

Mostly the people requesting the addition don&amp;rsquo;t have to live with the consequences.
These consequences double each and every time you add another option to an existing structure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every option you add, adds to the number of combinations your software must be capable to handle and combinations double according to the formula 2^n. So when you say yes for the 7th time. you go from 64 (2^6) to 128 (2^7) &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination#Number_of_k-combinations_for_all_k">combinations that need to work and tested&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>There is no fight</title><link>https://spectare.nl/posts/there-is-no-fight/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Sep 2020 08:48:08 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://spectare.nl/posts/there-is-no-fight/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today a respected colleague called and we had a conversation on technology choices. A team choose the React framework over the Angular framework and that caused a stir at the company.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He asked me what my top 5 elements for selection would be.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We ended up that a single question to answer should be enough.&lt;br>
Will the whole team take the responsibility to make this choice a success ?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sometimes the actual technology matters, most of the times, it matters more that ownership is at the right spot.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Flow based development</title><link>https://spectare.nl/posts/flow-based-development-intro/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Apr 2018 10:58:08 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://spectare.nl/posts/flow-based-development-intro/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="a-little-history-scrum-kanban-and-devops">A little history: Scrum, KanBan and DevOps&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Over the past 15 years, the IT industry has taken to working ‘agile’, often by introducing Scrum. Scrum is development process, which creates a cadence of sprints that last a few weeks each.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>User stories are used to determine the work to be done. These user stories are planned, committed, built and delivered. There is also room to evaluate the work, the object being to improve together.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://spectare.nl/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spectare.nl/contact/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="spectare-is-located-at">Spectare is located at:&lt;/h2>
