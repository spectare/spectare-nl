Mostly the people requesting the addition don&amp;rsquo;t have to live with the consequences. These consequences double each and every time you add another option to an existing structure.
Every option you add, adds to the number of combinations your software must be capable to handle and combinations double according to the formula 2^n. So when you say yes for the 7th time.</description></item><item><title>There is no fight</title><link>https://spectare.nl/posts/there-is-no-fight/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Sep 2020 08:48:08 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://spectare.nl/posts/there-is-no-fight/</guid><description>Today a respected colleague called and we had a conversation on technology choices. A team choose the React framework over the Angular framework and that caused a stir at the company.
He asked me what my top 5 elements for selection would be.

Will the whole team take the responsibility to make this choice a success ?
Sometimes the actual technology matters, most of the times, it matters more that ownership is at the right spot.</description></item></channel></rss>
