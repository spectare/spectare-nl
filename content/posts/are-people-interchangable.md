title: "Please don't assume teammembers are interchangable by standardisation"

### The organisation likes to re-assign one of their employees to help the team. 

1) Re-assignment assumes that employees are readily available. Consulantancy companies tend to have a bench for the people to be re-assigned to a customer project, for normal operational organisations this is hardly the case. 
2) It is safe to assume that you need to hire someone. Now the question is: If you can choose: Would you hire for technology compliancy or for matching domain knowledgde?
3) If you choose to hire for matching technology compliance, that is something to take along in your hiring process. 
4) When you hire for domain knowledge, something to take along is the ability to adopt technology in a timely way.

Depending on your situation you may choose for 3 or 4 and still have no reason to swap people around to other teams. 

Personally I believe willingness to learn is key whatever the domain or technology is.

### Someone appears to be readily available

Really? Thats quite a surpise - but hey - sometimes you may be lucky. 

When you hire based on the previous part, your team of people consists of people willing to learn whatever the domain or technology is. 
Technology knowledge is quite important but especially in existing teams key knowledge on the product at hand is already established. 
Domain knowledge on the level of detail the team internalised needs adoption by the new member. The new team member needs to become part of the shared understanding on the problem at hand.

It is a responsibilty of the team to enable a new member becoming up to par in a timely manner as there is not much a new member can do. 
Note that preparation up front is still a possibility - when the team enabled such a route as part of their introduction of new members. 

Standardisation on technology may be seen as a manner to enable interchangeability between people, I hope that this article clearly shows that most of the times people are not moved between teams and secondly when you do move people there are other things to solve.

Next to that, standardisation enables a culture of compliance. The drawbacks of this culture within an environment that must value learning are tremenduous and will prevent you towards a system that enables learning.

Sure, when you hire someone who is willing to learn, it certainly helps when the domain / technology is already part of past experience. But there may be other elements more important when you hire/add someone to a team, like personality, learning goals and background as moving towards a more diverse world in IT will certainly help a team to improve.
