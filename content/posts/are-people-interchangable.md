The ability the swap people in technology teams stays a fascinating assumption. 

## I've seen people reasoning that it is helpful to add people to a project when the deadline comes in sight. 

That one is debunked quite a while ago and is known as Brook's Law.

> Brooks's law is an observation about software project management according to which "adding manpower to a late software project makes it later". It was coined by Fred Brooks in his 1975 book The Mythical Man-Month. According to Brooks, an incremental person, when added to a project, makes it take more, not less time.

## Adding (restoring) capacity when a teammember is not available for longer times. 

A bit of background, this is a valid reason to get a new - temporary - team member on board. 
The organisation likes to re-assign one of their current employees to help the team. 

1) Re-assignment assumes that the current employees are available. Consulantancy companies tend to have a bench for the people waiting to be re-assigned to a customer project, for normal operational organisations this is hardly the case. 
2) It is safe to assume that you need to hire someone. Now the question is: If you can choose: Would you hire for technology compliancy or for matching domain knowledgde?
3) If you choose to hire for matching technology compliance, that is something to take along in your hiring process. 
4) When you hire for domain knowledge, something to take along is the ability to adopt technology in a timely way.

Depending on your situation you may choose for 3 or 4 and still have no reason to swap people around to other teams.
