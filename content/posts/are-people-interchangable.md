title: "Please don't assume teammembers are interchangable"

The ability the swap people in technology teams stays a fascinating assumption. 

I've seen people reasoning that it is helpful to add people to a project when the deadline comes in sight. 

That one is debunked quite a while ago and is known as Brook's Law.

Brooks's law is an observation about software project management according to which "adding manpower to a late software project makes it later". It was coined by Fred Brooks in his 1975 book The Mythical Man-Month. According to Brooks, an incremental person, when added to a project, makes it take more, not less time.

Adding (restoring) capacity when a teammember is not available for longer times. 

A bit of background, this is a valid reason to get a new - temporary - team member on board. Why it is within the reasoning here, is has todo with interchangability. The organisation likes to re-assign one of their current employees to help the team. 

1) Re-assignment assumes that the current employees is available or was working that has not the priority as seen in the team with the capacity gap. In most organisations, there is no bench sitting pool of people waiting to step in.
2) When you need to fill the gap, it is safe to assume that you need to hire someone. Now the question is: If you can choose: Would you hire for technology compliancy or for matching domain knowledgde ?
3) If you choose to hire for matching technology compliance, that is something to take along in your hiring process. 
4) When you hire for domain knowledge, something to take along is the ability to adopt technology in a timely way.

So, depending on your preferences - and probably at the type of issue that needs solving you may choose for 3 or 4 and still have no reason that people need to be swappable between teams.
