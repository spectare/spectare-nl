title: "Please don't assume teammembers are interchangable"
---

The organisation likes to re-assign one of their employees to help the team. 

1) Re-assignment assumes that employees are readily available. Consulantancy companies tend to have a bench for the people to be re-assigned to a customer project, for normal operational organisations this is hardly the case. 
2) It is safe to assume that you need to hire someone. Now the question is: If you can choose: Would you hire for technology compliancy or for matching domain knowledgde?
3) If you choose to hire for matching technology compliance, that is something to take along in your hiring process. 
4) When you hire for domain knowledge, something to take along is the ability to adopt technology in a timely way.

Depending on your situation you may choose for 3 or 4 and still have no reason to swap people around to other teams. 

Personally I believe willingness to learn is key whatever the domain or technology is.
