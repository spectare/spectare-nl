### The organisation likes to re-assign one of their employees to help the team. 

#### Is immediate replacement possible ?

Re-assignment assumes that employees are readily available. 
Consulantancy companies tend to have a bench for the people to be re-assigned to a customer project.

Do you work in an organisation that has people waiting to step in ? - Now you have the possiblity to work on team members being interchangeble. 

#### What is more important, knowledge of the standard or knowledge of the domain ?

Now the question is: If you can choose: Would you prefer technology compliancy or matching domain knowledgde?

When someone knows the technology, 

#### The concequenses to choose on ofer the other

When you choose to hire for matching technology compliance, that is something to take along in your hiring process. 

When you hire for domain knowledge, something to take along is the ability to adopt technology in a timely way.




Personally I believe willingness to learn is key whatever the domain or technology is.
