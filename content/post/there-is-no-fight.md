Today a respected colleague called and we had a conversation on technology choices. A team choose the React framework over the Angular framework and that caused a stir at the company.

He asked me what my top 5 elements for selection would be.

We ended up that a single question to answer should be enough: will the whole team take the responsibility to make this choice a success ?

Sometimes the actual technology matters, most of the times, it matters more that ownership is at the right spot.
