As the world becomes a network of people delivering digital solutions we need to change our approach to work.

In the last 10 years many exiting aproaches towards work were adopted by the technology industry leading towards 
enhanced approaches applicable to way we build software. 

And in these same years software practices are moving towards other industries. 

This combined knowlegde on how to organise and coordinate work with technology is applied by Spectare in the broadest sense of the word as all of these parts are a combined ecosystem.
