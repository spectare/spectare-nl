Goal is to get a better view on your situation and build knowledge on the situations that make you feel better or worse.

Day Score is an app that keeps track of your perceived day score each and every day and correlates it with additional (medical) information. This allows you to get a view on how you are doing during recovery or when you have a chronic disease.
